<h3><a name="overview">1. Study overview</a></h3>

<p>Following the emergence of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1), we
conducted a household transmission study based on a similar protocol to
our earlier
<a href="http://www.hku.hk/bcowling/influenza/HK_NPI_study.htm"
  title="Hong Kong NPI study">trial of non-pharmaceutical
interventions</a>, to establish the basic household epidemiology of
novel H1N1 and compare with seasonal influenza.</p>

<p>In July and August 2009 we recruited subjects presenting to outpatient 
clinics (in both the private and public sectors across Hong Kong) with 
influenza-like-illness of <48 hours duration. After influenza was
confirmed in an index case by the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test
the household of the index subject was recruited to our household
transmission study. We aimed to conduct an initial home
visit within 36 hours of recruitment, and evaluate subsequent
infections by self-reported daily symptom diaries and home visits
after 3 and 6 days. Nose and throat swabs were collected 
from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and
tested by RT-PCR. The primary outcome measure was laboratory-confirmed
influenza infection in a household contact by RT-PCR; the
secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza by self-reported
symptoms. We collected acute and convalescent sera from a subset of
participants and tested for antibody titers to seasonal and pandemic
influenza.</p>


<h3><a name="data">2. Raw data</a></h3>

<p>The latest version of the Hong Kong household transmission study is
available to download as a zip file here:</p>
<ul class="circle">
  <li><a href="http://sph.hku.hk/data/HongKongHTSV1.zip" title="Hong
  Kong household transmission data V1">HongKongHTSV1.zip</a>.
</ul> 
<p>This version of the dataset covers the transmission of influenza in households and 
adherence to interventions, antiviral treatment, quantitative
viral loads, serology, and data from recruiting clinics including
presenting symptoms and rapid test performance.</p>

<p>We provide our data under the <a 
href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/odc-public-domain-dedication-and-licence/">Open 
Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License</a>, which is a version of open
access for data. Under this licence we reserve no rights: 
there are no restrictions on use of our data, and no requirement to cite
our work or this website. However we would anticipate that for academic purposes the
standard practice of referencing sources would apply. We would like to hear from 
researchers who are using our data and we would be keen to work together on analyses.</p>


<h3><a name="main">3. Main findings</a></h3>

<p>The primary findings from our main study have been
published in 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20558368"
title="full text of Cowling et al., 2010, Ann Int Med">Cowling et
al. (2010, NEJM)</a>.

Our main findings were that RT-PCR-confirmed secondary attack rates
were similar among household contacts of index cases with pandemic
and seasonal influenza A, while patterns in viral shedding and course
of illness among index cases with pandemic and seasonal influenza A
were similar.</p>

<p>We have further analyses underway using the data from our study. More details will follow later.</p>

<h3><a name="comment">A comment on reproducible research</a></h3>

<p>We fully support the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0b013e318196784a">increasing calls</a>
from the academic community for 
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwj093" title="Peng et al., 2006, AJE">epidemiologic analyses to be reproducible</a>,
and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1745-6215-10-17" title="Hrynaszkiewicz and Altman, 2009, Trials">raw data from randomized controlled trials to be published</a>, as a part of the wider scientific endeavour to
replicate results.
Another example of this recommendation is in the <a
href="http://www.qve-goodpracticeguide.org.uk/guide#TOC-2.4-Inputs">Good
Practice Guide for Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiology</a>. 
Here we have published the raw <em>anonymised</em> data from our
household transmission study. We have also published
scripts which allow the analyses in our published papers to be reproduced.</p>

<p>Thousands of local people have given their time, and their families', as part of their
participation in our studies,
all in the expectation that our research studies will add to medical and scientific knowledge.
Participants should also expect that we will make the best possible use of the information that
we have collected about them. It would be difficult to argue that facilitating
best use of the data by the research community need not involve releasing raw data.</p>

<p>Publication of anonymised raw data has been approved by our local IRB and funding sources,
and participants were advised that anonymised data would be published during the informed consent
process. We anticipate that release of the raw data will:</p>
<ul class="circle">
 <li>Promote reproducibility of our results.
 <li>Allow other investigators to conduct their own analyses on our data.
 <li>Allow other investigators to compare our data with theirs, for
   example to explore similarities and differences between research findings.
 <li>Allow other investigators to prepare and plan for their own studies.
</ul>
